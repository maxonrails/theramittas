Start over on project 2 take 3.


PROJECT 2: RUBY ON RAILS!

The objective of this project is to:

Practice building basic Rails apps that connect to a relational database (PostgreSQL)
Use RESTful routes
Implement CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) functionality in an app
Write an authentication system by hand (no gems besides BCrypt!)
You will be working individually for this project, and you'll be designing the app yourself. Remember to keep things manageable -- scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for this project! You will be pitching your project idea to the instructors so that we can make sure your idea is in scope.

CORE REQUIREMENTS

Make sure to do all of the following with your app:

Rails 4 app with PostgreSQL database
At least two models (one of which should be a users model)
Full CRUD functionality in at least one controller (not including your users_controller)
Authentication by-hand, using BCrypt.
RESTful routes (at least 5)
Use Git and Github to version control your project
Track your progress and user stories in pivotal tracker
Deployed to Heroku
CHALLENGE ADD-ONS

These are for extra credit! Don't forget -- you must have your base app complete before you build any of these -- so plan for different stages of your project, including one that meets only the core requirements.

Style your app with Bootstrap/SASS
Have multiple models/additional controllers
Use an API -- Google Maps, Yelp, etc.
PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

Project Plan deliverables, due Friday, May 22, at the end of Week 4:

Pitch -- sell the instructional team on your project idea (make sure that it makes sense with the objectives!). Wireframes are optional but highly recommended!
User stories in Pivotal Tracker -- we'll be paying closer attention this time, so be sure to keep up with your Tracker
Data model. Show us your DB design!
Completed Project deliverables, due on demo day, Monday, June 8:

Link to Heroku hosted project
Link to source code on GitHub
TIMELINE

Things to keep in mind

DRY. Follow Ruby best practices!
RESTful. Do things the Rails way.
Well-formatted. Are you indenting well? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
Well-commented. Will we understand what is going on in each block or function?
Clear. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
Weâ€™ll also be looking at:

Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourself. Were you able to make the app you pitched? What makes it exceptional?
